Chur or Coire[3] is the capital of the Swiss canton of Graubünden and lies in the northern part of the canton.
The city, which is located on the right bank of the Rhine River, is reputedly the oldest town of Switzerland.
After the Napoleonic Wars, the Three Leagues became the canton of Graubünden in 1803.
The guild constitution of the city of Chur lasted until 1839, while in 1874 the Burgergemeinde was replaced by an Einwohnergemeinde.
When Graubünden became a canton in 1803, Chur was chosen as its capital.
The Romano-Gothic cathedral, where lie the remains of Jörg Jenatsch, was begun by Bishop Tello (758-73), and has a highly interesting crypt; it contains some remarkable paintings by Dürer and Holbein.
There are four archives or libraries; the bishop's palace (library and archive), the Cantonal Library, the Cantonal Archive of Graubünden and the city archive of Chur.
There are also four museums on the list; the Bündner Kunstmuseum (Art Museum), Bündner Naturmuseum (Natural History Museum), the Dommuseum and the Rätisches Museum in the Haus Buol.
The city's main railway station is where the Swiss Federal Railways system link with that of the Rhaetian Railway (RhB).
While the SBB lines serve most of Switzerland, most of Graubünden's internal rail traffic is served by RhB lines. One of the RhB lines (to Arosa) uses on-street running through streets in the centre of Chur and Sand in order to reach the station - see Chur stadtbahn.
